Once a message is moved to a **Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)** in **Amazon SQS**, it **will not** be processed again automatically. The purpose of a DLQ is to isolate and capture messages that could not be successfully processed after a specific number of attempts (defined by the **Maximum Receive Count**).

However, you have the option to manually retrieve and process the messages from the DLQ. To reprocess messages, you can:

1. **Manually Move Messages**: Retrieve messages from the DLQ and send them back to the main queue (or any other queue) for reprocessing.
2. **Automate Reprocessing**: Write an automation (using AWS Lambda, for example) that periodically checks the DLQ and moves or processes messages as needed.

### Steps to Manually Process Messages from a DLQ:

1. **Retrieve the Messages**: Use the AWS Console, AWS CLI, or SDK to poll and retrieve messages from the DLQ.
   
   Example using AWS CLI to retrieve messages:
   ```bash
   aws sqs receive-message --queue-url https://sqs.region.amazonaws.com/account-id/dlq-queue-name
   ```

2. **Send Messages Back to the Main Queue** (or any other processing queue):
   ```bash
   aws sqs send-message --queue-url https://sqs.region.amazonaws.com/account-id/main-queue-name --message-body "<your-message-body>"
   ```

### Automating Reprocessing (Optional):

You can set up a Lambda function to monitor the DLQ and move messages back to the main queue periodically. This setup can automate the process of re-queuing messages for further processing.

### Summary:
- **Automatic Reprocessing?**: No, once a message moves to a DLQ, it is not automatically reprocessed.
- **Manual Reprocessing**: You can manually reprocess messages from the DLQ by retrieving and sending them back to the main queue or another queue.
- **Automated Reprocessing**: You can automate the process by using services like AWS Lambda to periodically poll the DLQ and requeue messages for processing.
