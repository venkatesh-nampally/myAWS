### Amazon RDS Tutorial: Supported Database Engines, Automated Backups and Snapshots, Multi-AZ Deployments, and Read Replicas

This tutorial covers the key features of Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS), including supported database engines, automated backups and snapshots, Multi-AZ deployments, and read replicas. We'll provide step-by-step labs to help you gain hands-on experience with RDS.

### **Section 1: Supported Database Engines**

Amazon RDS supports multiple database engines. The main supported engines are:

- **Amazon Aurora** (compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- **MySQL**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **MariaDB**
- **Oracle**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**

#### Lab 1: Create an Amazon RDS Instance

1. **Login to the AWS Management Console:**
   - Navigate to the [RDS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds).
   
2. **Choose the Database Engine:**
   - Click **Create database**.
   - Choose a **database creation method**:
     - Select **Standard Create** for more customization.
   - Under **Engine options**, select the engine of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).
   
3. **Configure Database Settings:**
   - Choose the version of the database engine.
   - Under **Templates**, select the option (Production, Dev/Test, Free Tier).
   - Set the **DB Instance Identifier** (e.g., "mydbinstance").
   - Set the **Master Username** and **Master Password**.

4. **DB Instance Size and Storage:**
   - Choose the DB instance class (e.g., db.t3.micro for free-tier).
   - Set the allocated storage size (e.g., 20 GB).

5. **Connectivity Settings:**
   - Set the **VPC**, **Subnet**, **Public Access** based on your use case (choose "Yes" for Public Access for this tutorial).
   
6. **Launch the Database:**
   - Review your settings and click **Create Database**.
   
7. **Access the Database:**
   - Once the RDS instance is available, go to **Connectivity & security** in the RDS console to retrieve the **Endpoint**. You can connect to the RDS instance using any database client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin).

### **Section 2: Automated Backups and Snapshots**

Amazon RDS provides automated backups and manual snapshots to protect your data.

#### Lab 2: Configure Automated Backups

1. **Enable Automated Backups:**
   - When creating a new RDS instance, the **Backup retention period** option can be set under the **Backup** section.
   - Set the **Backup retention period** (between 1 and 35 days).
   - Choose the **Backup window** (the period when automated backups will occur).
   
2. **Verify Automated Backups:**
   - Navigate to the **Databases** section.
   - Select your RDS instance, then click on the **Backups** tab to verify that backups are occurring as per the schedule.

#### Lab 3: Create a Manual Snapshot

1. **Create a Manual Snapshot:**
   - In the RDS console, select your RDS instance.
   - In the **Actions** dropdown, choose **Take Snapshot**.
   - Enter a name for the snapshot (e.g., `manual-snapshot-1`) and click **Take Snapshot**.

2. **Restore from a Snapshot:**
   - Navigate to the **Snapshots** section in the RDS console.
   - Select the snapshot you created, click **Actions**, and choose **Restore Snapshot**.
   - Provide the necessary details (like DB Instance Identifier) and click **Restore**.

### **Section 3: Multi-AZ Deployments**

Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability and durability by automatically replicating your RDS instance across multiple availability zones.

#### Lab 4: Configure Multi-AZ Deployment

1. **Enable Multi-AZ During Database Creation:**
   - While creating a new RDS instance, under the **Availability & Durability** section, select **Multi-AZ Deployment**.
   - AWS will automatically configure replication for you across multiple Availability Zones.

2. **Verify Multi-AZ Deployment:**
   - Once the RDS instance is created, navigate to the **Connectivity & security** tab.
   - You should see a **Secondary Availability Zone** listed, which indicates that the Multi-AZ deployment is active.

3. **Failover Testing:**
   - AWS handles automatic failover in Multi-AZ setups, but you can manually trigger a failover to test it:
     - Go to the **Databases** section in the RDS console.
     - Select your RDS instance.
     - In the **Actions** dropdown, choose **Failover**.
     - AWS will fail over to the standby replica in another Availability Zone.
   
4. **Observe Failover:**
   - During failover, the instance's endpoint remains the same, but the replica in the secondary availability zone will become the primary instance. The process takes a few minutes.

### **Section 4: Read Replicas**

Amazon RDS read replicas allow you to replicate data across different AWS regions and instances for read scalability.

#### Lab 5: Create a Read Replica

1. **Create a Read Replica:**
   - In the RDS console, select your existing RDS instance.
   - From the **Actions** dropdown, select **Create Read Replica**.
   - Configure the Read Replica with your desired settings (instance class, storage, etc.).
   - Choose the target region and subnet group (optional).

2. **Access the Read Replica:**
   - After creation, the Read Replica will appear as a separate instance in the RDS console.
   - You can access it via the **Endpoint** in the same way you access the primary database, but it should only be used for read operations.

3. **Promote the Read Replica (optional):**
   - If needed, you can promote a Read Replica to become a standalone instance:
     - Select the Read Replica in the RDS console.
     - In the **Actions** dropdown, choose **Promote Read Replica**.
     - After promotion, the replica will no longer be synchronized with the primary instance.
