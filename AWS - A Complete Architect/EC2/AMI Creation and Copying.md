### **Step-by-Step Guide: Creating an AMI and Copying it from Hyderabad (ap-south-2) to Mumbai (ap-south-1) Region**

### **Overview**

An **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** is a snapshot of an EC2 instance that contains the operating system, application code, and data. You can use an AMI to launch EC2 instances that are configured identically. AWS allows you to create an AMI in one region and copy it to another region, making it available for use across multiple regions.

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of:

1. **Creating an AMI** from an EC2 instance in the **Hyderabad (ap-south-2)** region.
2. **Copying the AMI** to the **Mumbai (ap-south-1)** region.

### **Step 1: Create an AMI from an EC2 Instance in the Hyderabad Region (ap-south-2)**

#### **1.1. Launch an EC2 Instance in Hyderabad**

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
3. Click **Launch Instance**.
4. **Choose AMI**: Select an Amazon Machine Image (e.g., Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu).
5. **Choose Instance Type**: Select the instance type (e.g., `t2.micro` for the free tier).
6. **Configure Instance Details**: Ensure the region selected is **ap-south-2** (Hyderabad).
7. **Key Pair**: Select an existing key pair or create a new one for SSH access.
8. **Launch the Instance**.

#### **1.2. Customize the EC2 Instance (Optional)**

- Connect to the instance via SSH if necessary, and make any required configuration changes (e.g., install software, configure services).

#### **1.3. Create an AMI from the EC2 Instance**

1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** and select **Instances** from the left-hand menu.
2. **Select the Instance** you want to create an AMI from.
3. In the **Actions** dropdown, navigate to **Image and templates** > **Create image**.
4. **Configure Image**:
   - **Image Name**: Provide a meaningful name for your AMI (e.g., `MyHyderabadAMI`).
   - **Image Description**: (Optional) Add a description of the AMI.
   - **No reboot**: If you want the instance to remain running while the image is created, check this box (not recommended for consistency).
5. Click **Create Image**.

Your AMI creation will begin, and it may take a few minutes depending on the size of the instance and the amount of data. You can monitor the progress by going to the **AMIs** section under the **Images** category in the left-hand menu.

### **Step 2: Copy the AMI from Hyderabad (ap-south-2) to Mumbai (ap-south-1)**

#### **2.1. Locate the AMI in Hyderabad Region**

1. In the **EC2 Dashboard**, navigate to **Images** > **AMIs**.
2. Make sure the region is set to **Hyderabad (ap-south-2)**.
3. **Select the AMI** you just created from the list.

#### **2.2. Copy the AMI to Mumbai (ap-south-1)**

1. With your AMI selected, click the **Actions** dropdown and select **Copy AMI**.
2. In the **Copy AMI** window, configure the following:
   - **Destination Region**: Select **ap-south-1 (Mumbai)**.
   - **AMI Name**: Provide a name for the copied AMI (e.g., `MyMumbaiAMI`).
   - **Description**: (Optional) Add a description for the copied AMI.
3. Click **Copy AMI**.

AWS will now copy your AMI from Hyderabad to the Mumbai region. This process may take some time, depending on the size of the AMI.

#### **2.3. Verify the Copied AMI in Mumbai**

1. After the AMI is copied, switch to the **Mumbai (ap-south-1)** region in the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to **EC2 Dashboard** > **AMIs**.
3. You should now see your copied AMI listed in Mumbai.

### **Step 3: Launch an EC2 Instance from the Copied AMI in Mumbai**

1. In the **Mumbai (ap-south-1)** region, go to the **EC2 Dashboard**.
2. Click **Launch Instance**.
3. Select **My AMIs** on the left-hand side and choose the AMI you copied from Hyderabad.
4. Configure your instance settings (instance type, network settings, etc.).
5. **Launch the Instance**.

---

### **Summary**

- **Create an AMI** from an EC2 instance in **Hyderabad (ap-south-2)**.
- **Copy the AMI** to the **Mumbai (ap-south-1)** region.
- **Launch an EC2 instance** from the copied AMI in the Mumbai region.

This process enables you to quickly replicate the configuration of an EC2 instance across different AWS regions, ensuring consistency and ease of deployment for multi-region applications.
