### **AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) Types**

Amazon **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** provides block storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to EC2 instances and used as persistent storage. EBS offers several volume types that are optimized for different workloads, balancing price, performance, and capacity.

### **1. General Purpose SSD (gp3 and gp2)**

#### **gp3 (General Purpose SSD)**
- **Description**: The latest general-purpose SSD that offers predictable IOPS and throughput for a wide range of workloads.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for use cases like boot volumes, low-latency interactive apps, development, and test environments.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Baseline Performance**: 3,000 IOPS and 125 MB/s baseline throughput, regardless of volume size.
  - **Scalable Performance**: You can independently provision IOPS (up to 16,000) and throughput (up to 1,000 MB/s) without increasing volume size.
  - **Cost**: Lower cost than gp2 for similar workloads.

#### **gp2 (General Purpose SSD)**
- **Description**: An earlier version of general-purpose SSD that provides a balance of price and performance.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for a broad range of workloads, including boot volumes, medium-sized databases, and virtual desktops.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Baseline Performance**: 3 IOPS per GB of volume size, with the ability to burst up to 3,000 IOPS.
  - **Cost**: Performance scales with size. Larger volumes provide higher IOPS.

### **2. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 and io1)**

#### **io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)**
- **Description**: The latest generation of high-performance SSDs designed for critical applications with high durability and IOPS requirements.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for databases like Oracle, SQL Server, and NoSQL workloads that require high performance and durability.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Baseline Performance**: Can provision up to 64,000 IOPS per volume.
  - **Durability**: 99.999% durability, suitable for mission-critical applications.
  - **Cost**: Higher cost but provides high performance and durability.

#### **io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)**
- **Description**: An earlier version of provisioned IOPS SSD that allows high-performance storage for latency-sensitive applications.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for databases requiring very high IOPS, such as large-scale transactional databases.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Performance**: Can provision up to 64,000 IOPS, like io2, but with slightly lower durability (99.9%).
  - **Cost**: Higher cost, suitable for demanding workloads requiring high IOPS.

### **3. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**

- **Description**: A cost-effective magnetic storage option designed for large, sequential workloads that require high throughput rather than low-latency access.
- **Use Cases**: Best suited for workloads such as big data, data warehouses, and log processing that need frequent, large data transfers.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Performance**: Provides throughput of up to 500 MB/s, depending on the volume size.
  - **Cost**: Cheaper than SSD-based volumes, ideal for large data sets where throughput is more important than IOPS.

---

### **4. Cold HDD (sc1)**

- **Description**: The lowest-cost HDD option, designed for less frequently accessed data that needs long-term, inexpensive storage.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for cold storage, archival, and infrequent access workloads where performance is less critical (e.g., backups).
- **Key Features**:
  - **Performance**: Offers throughput of up to 250 MB/s, depending on the volume size.
  - **Cost**: Very low cost, ideal for storing infrequently accessed data.
