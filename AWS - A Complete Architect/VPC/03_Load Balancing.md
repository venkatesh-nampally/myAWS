### **3.3 Load Balancing**

**Load balancing** is a process that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed. By doing this, load balancers enhance the availability, reliability, and performance of applications. Load balancers sit between clients (users) and backend servers, routing requests to the most appropriate server based on the type of load balancing being used.

### **Why Load Balancing?**
- **Scalability**: Helps in scaling applications to handle an increasing number of requests.
- **Redundancy**: By spreading the traffic, load balancers prevent a single point of failure.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization**: Ensures efficient use of computing resources by distributing workloads.
- **High Availability**: Load balancers monitor the health of servers and reroute traffic to healthy ones, ensuring uptime.

### **Types of Load Balancers**

There are several types of load balancers, each working at different layers of the **OSI model**. The two most common types are **Layer 4** (Transport Layer) and **Layer 7** (Application Layer) load balancers.

#### **1. Layer 4 Load Balancers (Transport Layer)**
- **How It Works**: Layer 4 load balancers route traffic based on **IP addresses** and **port numbers**. They operate at the transport layer of the OSI model and direct traffic without inspecting its content.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for TCP/UDP traffic that doesn’t need content-based routing.
  
- **Example**: A Layer 4 load balancer can distribute traffic based on the IP address and port number without understanding the type of request, such as HTTP, HTTPS, or database requests.

- **Pros**: 
  - High performance, lower latency.
  - Can handle a wide range of protocols, not just HTTP.
  
- **Cons**: 
  - Limited visibility into the application-layer data.
  
- **Example**: **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** in AWS operates at Layer 4.

#### **2. Layer 7 Load Balancers (Application Layer)**
- **How It Works**: Layer 7 load balancers operate at the application layer of the OSI model. They can inspect the **HTTP/HTTPS headers** and content of the traffic to make more intelligent routing decisions.
- **Use Cases**: Best suited for web applications where content-based routing, such as directing traffic based on URLs, cookies, or HTTP headers, is needed.

- **Example**: A Layer 7 load balancer can route traffic to different backend servers depending on the URL path (e.g., requests for `/login` go to one server and `/products` to another).

- **Pros**:
  - Can route based on content (e.g., URLs, headers, methods, or cookies).
  - Offers advanced features such as SSL termination, sticky sessions, and WebSocket support.

- **Cons**:
  - Higher latency compared to Layer 4 due to deeper inspection of packets.
  
- **Example**: **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** in AWS operates at Layer 7.

### **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) in AWS**

In AWS, **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, or Lambda functions. AWS offers three types of load balancers to handle different traffic patterns and application needs: **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**, and **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**.

#### **1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)**
- **Layer**: Operates at **Layer 7** (Application Layer).
- **Purpose**: Ideal for **HTTP** and **HTTPS** traffic, ALB supports advanced routing based on content, such as URL paths, hostnames, or HTTP headers.
  
- **Features**:
  - **Content-Based Routing**: Route traffic based on URL paths or HTTP headers. For example, traffic to `/login` can be sent to one target group while `/products` can go to another.
  - **Host-Based Routing**: Route traffic based on the hostname (e.g., `www.example.com` vs `api.example.com`).
  - **SSL Termination**: ALB can manage the SSL certificate, terminating SSL connections and decrypting the traffic before routing it.
  - **WebSocket Support**: ALB supports WebSocket connections for real-time applications.
  - **Sticky Sessions**: Session persistence based on cookies, ensuring that subsequent requests from the same client go to the same server.
  
- **Use Case**: 
  - Web applications requiring advanced request routing based on HTTP/HTTPS headers, URLs, or hostnames.
  - Applications needing WebSocket or sticky sessions.

- **Example**: 
  - A web application might use an **ALB** to route requests to `/login` to one set of servers that handle authentication, while `/products` requests are routed to another set of servers that handle product information.

#### **2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)**
- **Layer**: Operates at **Layer 4** (Transport Layer).
- **Purpose**: Designed for high-performance applications that require low latency and can handle millions of requests per second.
  
- **Features**:
  - **TCP and UDP Traffic**: Supports both TCP and UDP traffic.
  - **Static IP**: NLB provides a static IP address for load balancer endpoints, which makes it ideal for applications requiring fixed IP addresses.
  - **High Scalability**: Capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latency.
  - **Health Checks**: NLB monitors the health of the backend instances and only routes traffic to healthy instances.
  
- **Use Case**:
  - Applications requiring **high throughput and low latency**, such as gaming, financial applications, or real-time data streaming.
  - Applications that require **TCP** or **UDP** protocol handling.
  
- **Example**:
  - A financial trading platform could use an NLB to distribute TCP traffic to multiple EC2 instances to handle high-frequency trades.

#### **3. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**
- **Layer**: Operates at **Layer 3** (Network Layer).
- **Purpose**: Used to simplify the deployment, scaling, and management of third-party virtual appliances, such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems.
  
- **Features**:
  - **IP Traffic Routing**: Routes traffic based on IP addresses.
  - **Transparent Network Appliance Insertion**: Integrates with virtual appliances like firewalls, IDS/IPS, and DDoS protection.
  
- **Use Case**:
  - Deploying and scaling third-party network appliances such as firewalls, intrusion detection, or deep packet inspection systems.
  
- **Example**:
  - A large enterprise might use a GWLB to direct traffic through a virtual firewall before it reaches their backend servers.

### **How Elastic Load Balancing Works in AWS**

1. **Listener**: A listener is a process that checks for connection requests. You define rules on the listener to determine how traffic is forwarded to the backend servers.
   - **For ALB**: The listener could be an HTTP or HTTPS listener that routes traffic based on URL paths or hostnames.
   - **For NLB**: The listener could be a TCP or UDP listener that forwards traffic based on ports.

2. **Target Groups**: Target groups contain the backend servers (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, or Lambda functions) that receive traffic. You can define health checks to monitor the status of the targets in the group.

3. **Health Checks**: ELB monitors the health of registered targets in the target group. If a target becomes unhealthy, ELB will stop routing traffic to it until it recovers.

4. **Scaling**: AWS automatically scales the load balancer to handle incoming traffic. This is especially useful during high-traffic periods.

### **Example of Elastic Load Balancer in Action**

Let’s assume you have a web application hosted on multiple EC2 instances:

- **Scenario**: You have 4 EC2 instances spread across two availability zones. You want to distribute incoming HTTP traffic evenly across these instances.

- **Solution**:
  1. **Create an Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
  2. Define a **HTTP listener** on port 80 that forwards traffic to a target group containing your EC2 instances.
  3. Configure **host-based routing** so that traffic to `api.example.com` is routed to one set of instances, while traffic to `www.example.com` is routed to another set of instances.
  4. The ALB will monitor the health of your EC2 instances and ensure traffic is only sent to healthy instances.
  
- **Benefit**: Your web application will now handle large volumes of incoming requests, distributing the load evenly across multiple servers, ensuring scalability and high availability.
