When you're not using **AWS Transit Gateway** and instead rely on **VPC Peering** to connect multiple VPCs, you need to establish **point-to-point connections** between each pair of VPCs. This creates a **mesh network**, where each VPC needs a route to every other VPC.

For **6 VPCs**, the number of **VPC peering connections** and **route table entries** needed follows this pattern:

### **1. Number of VPC Peering Connections**

To connect **6 VPCs** directly, each VPC needs a peering connection with every other VPC. The number of connections needed to fully mesh **n** VPCs is given by the formula for combinations:

\[
\text{Peering Connections} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

For **6 VPCs**:

\[
\text{Peering Connections} = \frac{6(6-1)}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15
\]

You will need **15 VPC peering connections** to fully mesh 6 VPCs.

### **2. Route Table Entries**

In a **VPC peering setup**, for each peering connection, you need a route table entry in each VPC's route table for every other VPC. Each VPC will require route entries for every other VPC.

For each VPC, it needs to communicate with the other **5 VPCs**, so you will need **5 route table entries** per VPC.

Since there are **6 VPCs**, the total number of route table entries across all VPCs is:

\[
\text{Total Route Table Entries} = 6 \times 5 = 30
\]

Thus, you will need **30 route table entries** in total.

### **Summary of the Math**

- **VPC Peering Connections**: To fully mesh **6 VPCs**, you need **15 peering connections**.
- **Route Table Entries**: Each VPC will need **5 route table entries**, and for **6 VPCs**, you will need **30 total route table entries**.

### **Comparison with AWS Transit Gateway**

If you use an **AWS Transit Gateway**, you would only need:
- **6 Transit Gateway attachments** (one per VPC).
- **1 centralized Transit Gateway route table** to manage the routing for all VPCs, significantly reducing the complexity.

This makes **AWS Transit Gateway** more scalable and manageable when dealing with multiple VPCs.
