When you type a URL like `www.google.com` into your web browser, a series of steps occur to translate that human-readable address into an IP address that computers use to communicate with each other. Here's a detailed breakdown of how DNS (Domain Name System) works and what happens when you type `www.google.com` in your browser:

### 1. **Browser Cache Lookup**
The first thing that happens is that your web browser checks its **local cache** to see if it has recently looked up the IP address for `www.google.com`. Browsers store DNS records for a short period to avoid unnecessary DNS lookups for frequently visited websites.
- **If found**: The browser directly uses the cached IP address to request the website.
- **If not found**: The DNS lookup process begins.

### 2. **Operating System Cache (DNS Resolver Cache)**
If the IP address isn’t found in the browser cache, the browser checks the **operating system’s DNS cache** (called the DNS resolver cache). The operating system keeps a cache of previously queried DNS records.
- **If found**: The operating system returns the IP address to the browser, and the website request proceeds.
- **If not found**: The query is forwarded to the next level of DNS resolution.

### 3. **Query Sent to DNS Resolver (ISP or Custom Resolver)**
If the IP address isn’t found in the local caches, the operating system sends a query to a **DNS Resolver** (often provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), or a custom DNS like Google DNS, Cloudflare, etc.).
- The resolver is responsible for finding the IP address for `www.google.com`.

### 4. **DNS Resolver Checks Its Cache**
The DNS Resolver checks its own cache to see if it has a recent lookup of `www.google.com`.
- **If found**: It returns the IP address to the browser, and the process moves forward.
- **If not found**: The resolver begins querying the DNS hierarchy.

### 5. **Query Sent to Root DNS Server**
If the DNS resolver doesn’t have the IP address, it sends a query to one of the **Root DNS Servers**. Root servers are at the top of the DNS hierarchy, and they contain information about the authoritative servers for each top-level domain (TLD) like `.com`, `.net`, `.org`, etc.
- The Root DNS server doesn't know the IP address for `www.google.com`, but it knows where to find the **authoritative DNS servers for the `.com` domain**.
- The Root server responds with the IP address of the **TLD Name Server** responsible for `.com` domains.

### 6. **Query Sent to TLD Name Server (Top-Level Domain Server)**
Next, the DNS resolver queries the **TLD Name Server** for `.com`. The TLD server knows the authoritative name servers for domains under `.com`.
- The TLD server responds with the IP address of **Google’s authoritative DNS servers** for the domain `google.com`.

### 7. **Query Sent to Authoritative Name Server**
Now, the DNS resolver queries the **authoritative DNS server** for `google.com`. This server is responsible for knowing the IP addresses associated with `www.google.com`.
- The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address of the **Google web server** (e.g., `142.250.190.4`).

### 8. **DNS Resolver Caches the Result**
The DNS resolver caches this IP address for future requests (for a time specified in the record’s TTL, or Time To Live), and then it returns the IP address to the operating system.

### 9. **Operating System Caches the Result**
The operating system caches the IP address as well for future lookups and returns the IP address to the browser.

### 10. **Browser Connects to the Web Server**
Now that the browser has the IP address of `www.google.com` (e.g., `142.250.190.4`), it proceeds to establish a **TCP connection** to that IP address using port 80 (for HTTP) or port 443 (for HTTPS).

### 11. **HTTP/HTTPS Request**
- Once the connection is established, the browser sends an **HTTP or HTTPS request** to the server (in this case, Google's server), asking for the content of the page `www.google.com`.

### 12. **Server Responds**
The web server at `142.250.190.4` (Google’s server) processes the request and sends back the **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and other resources needed to display the webpage.

### 13. **Rendering the Web Page**
The browser receives the server's response, processes the HTML and other assets, and **renders the webpage** for you to see.

### **Summary of the Steps:**
1. **Browser Cache**: Browser checks its cache for the IP.
2. **OS Cache**: If not found, the OS checks its DNS cache.
3. **DNS Resolver Query**: The OS sends a request to a DNS resolver (often your ISP).
4. **Root DNS Query**: If the resolver doesn’t know the IP, it queries a Root DNS server.
5. **TLD Server Query**: The Root server directs the resolver to a TLD server (for `.com`).
6. **Authoritative DNS Query**: The TLD server provides the address of the authoritative DNS server for `google.com`.
7. **IP Address Found**: The authoritative server returns the IP address of `www.google.com`.
8. **Caching**: The resolver and OS cache the IP address for future lookups.
9. **Browser Connects**: The browser connects to the IP and sends an HTTP/HTTPS request.
10. **Server Responds**: Google’s server sends back the webpage content.
11. **Web Page Displays**: The browser renders the content and displays the webpage.
